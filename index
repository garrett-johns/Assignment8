<p>Red cardinals in the white snow<br />
They got too high to fly home for the winter<br />
And I had a roommate once, he got so high<br />
He couldn't go out at night<br />
So, he found love on the internet
<p>
<p>And it's freezing in Pennsylvania<br />
And the rest of the birds are Turjks and Kaicos<br />
And it's like a truth commercial, but we feel bad<br />
So, we get stoned and do snow angels
<p>
<p>Ooh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh<br />
<p>
<p>So, we bought a broke down bus<br />
And painted it green<br />
And we danced in the parking lot<br />
Under the shadow of '95
<p>
<p>And all of my favorite people<br />
They don't march to the beat of your drum<br />
They just keep on keeping on
<p>
<p>And whatever you're supposed to be<br />
Whatever that's supposed to mean<br />
I just wanted you to know<br />
That you don't have to come clean to me
<p>
<p>Yeah, everything's exact<br />
Everything's exactly where it needs to be<br />
I just wanted you to know<br />
That you don't have to come clean to me
<p>
<p>Yeah, everything's exact<br />
Everything's exact<br />
Everything's exactly where it needs to be
<p>
<p>Wolves are circling<br />
Black ties suit them<br />
The wolves start circling<br />
Black ties suit them
<p>
<p>So, we light one up, 'cause it's in our blood<br />
It's in our blood, ah

<p>Wolves start circling, black ties suit them<br />
Wolves start circling, black ties suit them<br />
Wolves start circling, black ties suit them, Lord<br />
And they're not like us
